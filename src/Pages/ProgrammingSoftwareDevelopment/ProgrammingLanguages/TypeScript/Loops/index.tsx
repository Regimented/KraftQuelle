      <p>
        Loops are essential control structures in TypeScript and other
        programming languages that allow you to execute a block of code
        repeatedly. They are used when you need to perform the same operation
        multiple times or iterate through collections of data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        TypeScript supports all JavaScript loop types including for, while,
        do-while, and for...of loops, along with array methods like forEach,
        map, and filter. The static typing system in TypeScript adds an extra
        layer of safety when working with loops, helping prevent common errors
        by ensuring type consistency.

        Choosing the right loop for a given task can significantly impact code
        readability and performance. For example, for loops are often ideal for
        iterating a specific number of times, while while loops are better
        suited for situations where the number of iterations is not known in
        advance.
