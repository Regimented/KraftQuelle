        <p>
          Functions are fundamental building blocks in programming languages,
          including TypeScript. They encapsulate reusable blocks of code
          designed to perform specific tasks, promoting modularity, readability,
          and maintainability in software development. A function typically
          takes input in the form of parameters, processes it, and returns an
          output, though it can also execute actions without returning a value.

          In TypeScript, functions enhance JavaScriptâ€™s capabilities by adding
          static typing, allowing developers to define parameter types and
          return types explicitly. This type safety helps catch errors during
          development, making code more predictable and easier to debug.
          Functions can be defined using traditional syntax, arrow functions, or
          as methods within objects and classes, offering flexibility to suit
          different programming paradigms.

          Common uses of functions include performing calculations, manipulating
          data, handling events, and abstracting complex logic into manageable
          units. In TypeScript, features like optional parameters, default
          values, and function overloading further extend their utility,
          enabling developers to write expressive and robust code tailored to
          specific needs.
